    <h1>Dispelling event myths</h1>
    <p>
        The previous parts in this book should have given you a solid and broad foundation
        in the fundamentals of Rx. We will use this based to learn the really fun and sometimes
        complex parts of Rx. Just before we do, I want to first make sure we are all on
        the same page and dispel some common myths and misunderstandings. Carrying these
        misconceptions into a world of concurrency will make things seem magic and mysterious.
        This normally leads to problematic code.

    <h2>Event myths</h2>
    <p>
        Often in my career, I have found myself involved in the process of interviewing
        new candidates for developer roles. I have often been surprised about the lack of
        understanding developers had surrounding .NET events. Carrying these misconceptions
        into a world of concurrency will make things seem magic and mysterious. This normally
        leads to problematic code. Here is a short list of verifiable facts about events.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Events are just a syntactic implementation of the observer pattern</dt>
        <dd>
            The += and -= syntax in c# may lead you to think that there is something clever
            going on here, but it is just the observer pattern; you are providing a delegate
            to get called back on. Most events pass you data in the form of the sender and the
            <em>EventArgs</em>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Events are multicast</dt>
        <dd>
            Many consumers can register for the same event. Each delegate (handler) will be
            internally added to a callback list.
        </dd>
        <dt>Events are single threaded.</dt>
        <dd>
            There is nothing multithreaded about an event. Each of the callback handlers are
            each just called in the order that they registered, and they are called sequentially.
        </dd>
        <dt>Event handlers that throw exceptions stop other handlers being called</dt>
        <dd>
            Since handlers are called sequentially, they are also called on the same thread
            that raised the event. This means that, if one handler throws an exception, there
            cannot be a chance for any user code to intercept the exception. This means that
            the remaining handlers will not be called.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        Common myths about events that I have heard (or even believed at some point) include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handlers are called all at the same time on the thread pool, in parallel</li>
        <li>All handlers will get called. Throwing an exception from a handler will not affect
            other handlers</li>
        <li>You don't need to unregister an event handler, .NET is managed so it will garbage
            collect everything for you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The silly thing about these myths is that it only takes fifteen minutes to prove
        them all wrong; you just open up Visual Studio or <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">
            LINQPad</a> and test them out. In my opinion, there is something satisfying
        about proving something you only believed in good faith to be true.

    <h2>Memory management myths</h2>
    <p>
        Event handles 
        IDispose pattern 
        Finalise is just as good as Dispose 
        GC is free 
        Setting to NULL is the same as Dispose or finalise
